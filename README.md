- 👋🏽 Hello there! I’m Dominic Amoak, a budding software developer with a BSc. Computer Engineering. I love to create stuff.

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and my aspiration is to become a software developer. My current skillset are mostly in line with     frontend development thus, HTML,CSS, SASS and Flutter. I am currently learning Javascript and I hold interest in Python as well.

- 🎹 Other aspects of my life are also on the creative side. I love to write and produce music. I also write stories and do some 2D artworks (my works are mainly on my alternate     instagram account, thus @dexterousstudiosgh). I'm also into 3D animation, a skill I picked up after high school.
 
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects that will challenge and help in my growth as a software developer.

- 📫 You can reach me on twitter at @dommyscriptz00.


I'm looking forward to this developer journey and I'm open to learning as well as being mentored.
